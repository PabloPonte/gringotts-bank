```
Suggestions 

It is strongly recommended to adopt an agile methodology; either Scrum or Kanban are the best options here.

Keep in mind that the workflow, states, and task types can be dependent on the chosen tool.

Any management tool can be used. The most popular one is Jira from Atlassian. Other common options include TFS from Microsoft, Redmine, or Trello Boards (for smaller projects).
